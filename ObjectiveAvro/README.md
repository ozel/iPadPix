## What is ObjectiveAvro?

**ObjectiveAvro** is a wrapper on [Avro-C](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/api/c/index.html), following the API conventions of Foundation's `NSJSONSerialization` class.

## But what is this Avro thing?

From [Avro Documentation](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/):

> Apache Avroâ„¢ is a data serialization system.

> Avro provides:

>    - Rich data structures.
>    - A compact, fast, binary data format.
>    - A container file, to store persistent data.
>    - Remote procedure call (RPC).
>    - Simple integration with dynamic languages. Code generation is not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols. Code generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically typed languages.

Basically, you can serialize data to a fast and compact binary format (which is very handy on a mobile device!). However, there isn't an official API for Objective-C, only C, C++, C#, Java and Python. **ObjectiveAvro** is the midfield between your Objective-C code and [Avro-C](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/api/c/index.html).

## Usage Examples

### Registering schemas

Avro works with [schemas](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/index.html#schemas). Before using `OAVAvroSerialization` to serialize objects, you must register the schemas you'll use.

```objective-c
NSString *schema = @"{\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"Person\",\"namespace\":\"com.movile.objectiveavro.unittest.v1\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"country\",\"type\":\"string\"},{\"name\":\"age\",\"type\":\"int\"}]}";

OAVAvroSerialization *avro = [[OAVAvroSerialization alloc] init];
NSError *error;
BOOL result = [avro registerSchema:schema error:&error];
```    

### Transforming JSON to NSData

```objective-c
NSError *error;
NSDictionary *dict = @{@"name": @"Marcelo Fabri", @"country": @"Brazil", @"age": @20};
NSData *data = [avro dataFromJSONObject:dict forSchemaNamed:@"Person" error:&error];
```

### Transforming NSData to JSON

```objective-c
NSError *error;
NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"marcelo" ofType:@"avro"]];
NSData *data = [avro JSONObjectFromData:data forSchemaNamed:@"Person" error:&error];
```

## Requirements

**ObjectiveAvro** requires Xcode 5, targeting either iOS 6.0 and above, or Mac OS 10.8 Mountain Lion ([64-bit with modern Cocoa runtime](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtVersionsPlatforms.html)) and above.

**ObjectiveAvro** also requires [Avro-C](http://avro.apache.org/docs/current/api/c/index.html), which is automatically imported when using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).

## Installation

**ObjectiveAvro** is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "ObjectiveAvro"

## Testing

To run the testing project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. You can run the unit tests by pressing `CMD + U` on Xcode.
Tests are done with `XCTest` and [`Expecta`](https://github.com/specta/expecta).

## Known limitations

- Currently, only the following types are supported: `string`, `float`, `double`, `int`, `long`, `boolean`, `null`, `bytes`, `array`, `map` and `record`. That means that `enum`, `union` and `fixed` **are not** currently supported.
